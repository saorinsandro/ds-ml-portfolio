# Real or Not Real? NLP with Disasters Tweets

-  My first ML project developed in 2020, where I created a model to predict which Tweets mention real disasters using Natural Language Processing and some ML Models.<br />

  <br />**Highlights from this project:**
  <br />- Preprocessing tweets data with text preprocessing pipeline using some NLTK tools;
  <br />- Transforming the data with TfIdfVectorizer;
  <br />- Visualizing the word distribution with PCA and t-SNE;
  <br />- Testing a list of models and choose a best model using ROC-AUC curve;
  <br />- Choosing the best threshold that improves the model results based on preferred metrics.<br />
  <br />*Tools: NLTK, TfidfVectorizer, SKLearn;*<br /><br />
